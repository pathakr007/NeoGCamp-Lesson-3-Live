          JavaScript has evolved over the past 25 years to become a versatile and accessible programming language for working with web browsers. Developers use JavaScript to build complex interactive websites and browser games, and to connect servers to websites and web applications. Because of this versatility, it’s easy to see why this language is the most commonly used programming language in the world.
        </p>
  
        <h2>Creating Interactive Websites</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript makes web pages dynamic. Before JavaScript, web pages were built only with HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are only capable of creating static pages that can be styled but not interactive aside from hyperlinks. Some of the most popular websites are built with JavaScript, including Google, YouTube, and Facebook.
        </p>
  
        <h2>
          Building Applications 
        </h2>
        <p>
          With JavaScript’s extensive collection of frameworks, developers can efficiently build apps for mobile and web. Frameworks are libraries of pre-written JavaScript code that developers use for standard features. You can think of a JavaScript framework like a blueprint. The most popular JavaScript application frameworks are: <strong> React </strong>: a collection of JavaScript created to build user interfaces for web applications, <strong> React Native </strong>: a collection that allows developers to build mobile apps with JavaScript, <strong> Node.js </strong> a collection that enables two-way communications with servers for exchanging data.
        </p>
  <p>
          Facebook built React and React Native, which are currently powering some of the world’s most powerful social media applications. React is used by websites like Uber, Pinterest, Netflix, Instagram, Amazon, Twitter, Udemy, and more. Facebook, Instagram, Shopify, Words with Friends, Skype, Pinterest, Discord, Tesla, and Uber Eats use React Native.
        </p>
  <h2> Developing Engaging Games </h2>
  <p>JavaScript is frequently used to create in-browser games. Developers use JavaScript to create 2D and 3D puzzles, role-playing games, racing games, platform games, and more. Creating a simple browser game can be a great way to start practicing your JavaScript skills as a beginner. There are hundreds of JavaScript game engines that provide frameworks for buidling games, and many are free and open-source. The most popular game engines include Backbone, DarlingJS, and JawsJS.
